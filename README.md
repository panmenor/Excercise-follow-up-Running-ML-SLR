# Exercise-follow-up-Running-ML-SLR
I have been a runner for the last 9 years, and I took my exercise follow up pretty seriously. 
That is why I created a dataset with relevant data about each training session. I have been updating it since 2013, and currently the dataset has 281 records!
This is my first ML model. I used a simple linear regression to predict the duration of my running sessions based on the number of kilometers run.
Please let me know in case you consider possible improvements to the model!
